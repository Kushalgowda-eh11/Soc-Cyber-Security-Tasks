The program never checks:
File type
File size
Path traversal

An attacker can pass:

../../../../etc/shadow


This is a Path Traversal vulnerability.

 Combined Exploit Chain

A real attacker would:

->Read sensitive files → steal credentials
->Leak memory → get memory layout
->Use format string → overwrite memory
->Trigger heap overflow → execute shellcode

 This becomes a full Remote Code Execution attack

 Secure Version (Fix)
code:
std::ifstream ifs(filename, std::ios::binary | std::ios::ate);
std::streamsize size = ifs.tellg();
ifs.seekg(0, std::ios::beg);

std::vector<char> buffer(size + 1);
ifs.read(buffer.data(), size);
buffer[size] = '\0';

printf("%s\n", buffer.data());
