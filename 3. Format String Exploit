code:
printf("%s\n", buffer[0]);

This is catastrophic.

buffer[0] is a char, not a string.

It gets treated as:

code:
memory address = ASCII value of first byte
So if the file starts with:

ini
'A' = 0x41
Then:
css code
printf reads from memory address 0x41
🔥 Attackers can do:
If the first byte is %

ini
0x25 = '%'
Now printf interprets format specifiers:

perl

%n → write to memory
%x → leak memory
%s → read arbitrary memory
➡️ This becomes a Format String Vulnerability
➡️ Can lead to full system compromise
