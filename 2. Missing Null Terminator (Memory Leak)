code:
buffer = (char*) malloc(length+1);
ifs.read(buffer, pbuf->in_avail());
printf("%s\n", buffer[0]);

They allocate +1 byte, but they never add:
code:
buffer[length] = '\0';

So printf keeps reading memory past the buffer until it finds a \0.

🔥 What does this leak?

Passwords
Pointers
Stack data
Heap addresses

This is called:

Information Disclosure Vulnerability
This helps attackers bypass ASLR and exploit the system.
